# Comprehensive-Sales-and-Customer-Analysis-with-Pandas-and-Matplotlib
This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer data to extract meaningful insights and solve potential business problems using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. It includes tasks like data cleaning, descriptive analysis, transformations, and visualization.

Dataset Columns

The dataset includes the following columns:

transactions_id

sale_date

sale_time

customer_id

gender

age

category

quantity

price_per_unit

cogs

total_sale

Objective

To analyze the sales and customer data, identify patterns, and provide actionable business insights through various analysis techniques and visualizations.

Tasks Covered

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle null or missing values.

Data Type Validation: Ensure all columns have correct data types (e.g., date and time columns).

Handle Duplicates: Remove duplicate records.

Outlier Detection: Detect and handle outliers in numerical columns like price_per_unit, age, and total_sale.

Correct Column Names: Rename columns for consistent formatting (e.g., lowercase and underscore-separated).

2. Descriptive Analysis

Customer Demographics: Analyze gender and age distribution.

Top-Selling Categories: Identify the top 5 most frequently sold categories.

Sales Performance by Time: Determine peak sales hours by analyzing sales variations by day and time.

3. Data Transformation

Create New Columns:

Profit: total_sale - cogs

Day of Week: Extract the day of the week from sale_date.

Age Group: Categorize customers into age groups (e.g., <20, 20–40, 40+).

4. Aggregation and Grouping

Sales by Category: Find total, average, and count of sales for each category.

Profit by Customer Demographics: Analyze profit by gender and age group.

Quantity Sold by Time: Group by sale_time (e.g., hourly intervals) to observe fluctuations in sales.

5. Filtering and Sorting

High-Spending Customers: Identify customers whose total purchases exceed a certain threshold.

Low-Performing Categories: Filter categories with total sales below a specified value.

6. Time-Series Analysis

Monthly Trends: Analyze monthly sales trends using the sale_date column.

Seasonal Patterns: Identify seasonal sales patterns (e.g., higher sales during specific months).

7. Customer Segmentation

Customer Lifetime Value: Calculate total sales and total quantity purchased by each customer_id.

Churn Analysis: Identify customers who haven’t made a purchase in the last 3 months.

8. Advanced Analysis

Price Sensitivity: Examine the relationship between price_per_unit and quantity to understand price elasticity.

Category Profitability: Identify the most and least profitable categories.

Gender Purchase Patterns: Compare category preferences across genders.

9. Visualization Preparation

Prepare insights for visualizations (e.g., sales trends, top categories, peak hours) to enable data-driven decision-making.
